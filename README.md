## 🌟 What is StillMe?

StillMe is a **Self-Evolving AI System** that continuously learns from the internet, adapts to new information, and evolves through different developmental stages - just like a growing organism. Unlike traditional AI systems that remain static, StillMe gets smarter every day.

### 🎯 Core Concept

- **🧬 Evolutionary Learning**: AI progresses through stages (Infant → Child → Adolescent → Adult)
- **📚 Multi-Source Learning**: RSS feeds + Public APIs integration
- **🌐 Real-time Data**: Live data from multiple trusted sources with transparency
- **🛡️ Ethical Filtering**: Comprehensive ethical content filtering with complete transparency
- **📊 Transparent Dashboard**: Complete visibility into all learning sources and data
- **💬 Interactive Chat**: Communicate with your evolving AI assistant

## 🛡️ Our Uncompromising Commitment

### 🌟 **100% Transparency - Nothing to Hide**
- **Every line of code is public** - no "black box", no proprietary algorithms
- **Every API call is visible** - see exactly what AI learns from and when
- **Every decision is transparent** - from ethical filtering to quality assessment
- **Complete audit trail** - full history of all learning decisions and violations

### 🎯 **Ethical AI - Our Highest Priority**
We believe that **ethics isn't a feature - it's the foundation**. StillMe is built with unwavering principles:

- **Safety First**: Harmful content filtered at the source
- **Cultural Fairness**: Respects global diversity and perspectives  
- **Full Accountability**: Every mistake is public and corrected
- **Community Control**: You decide what's acceptable, not corporations

> **"We challenge the AI community to choose: Support transparency and ethics, or remain silent and admit they don't care."**

### 🔒 **Privacy & Data Protection**
- **No personal data collection** - learns only from public sources
- **Self-hosted codebase** - you maintain complete control over your data
- **Delete anytime** - your data, your rules, your control

## 🛡️ Ethical AI Transparency

StillMe features the world's first **completely transparent ethical filtering system**:

- **Complete Visibility**: All ethical violations are logged and visible
- **Open Source**: Filtering rules and algorithms are publicly available
- **Community Driven**: Blacklist and rules can be managed by the community
- **Audit Trail**: Full history of all ethical decisions and violations
- **Configurable**: Ethics level can be adjusted based on community needs

This transparency ensures StillMe learns responsibly while maintaining community trust.
