Iman and I (Fabian) have been building Specific for a while now and are finally opening up our public beta.Specific is a platform for building backend APIs and services entirely through natural-language specifications and tests, without writing code. We then automatically turn your specs into a working system and deploy it for you, along with any infrastructure needed.We know a lot of developers who have already adopted spec-driven development to focus on high-level design and let coding agents take care of implementation. We are attempting to take this even further by making the specs themselves the source of truth. Of course, we can’t blindly trust coding agents to follow the spec, so we also support adding tests that will run to ensure the system behaves as expected and to avoid regressions.There is so much ground to cover, so we are focusing on a smaller set of initial features that in our experience should cover a large portion of backends:- An HTTP server for each project. Authentication can be added by simply stating in the spec how you want to protect your endpoint.- A database automatically spun up and schema configured if the spec indicates persistence is needed.- External APIs can be called. You can even link out to API docs in your specs.You currently can’t see the generated code, but we are working on enabling it. Of course, we don’t claim any ownership of the generated code and will gladly let you export it and continue building elsewhere.Specific is free to try and we are really eager to hear your feedback on it!Try it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.specific.dev",

I’d save reels and shorts—workout tips, recipes, travel spots—thinking I’d find them again later. But, like most people, I ended up with a black hole of unsorted videos: no search, no filters, and if I ever did find the right video again, I’d have to dig through the whole thing just to get that one detail I needed.When I tried looking for solutions, I found only genre-specific apps or tools that demanded manual uploads or new workflows. None felt like they understood how real users behave or save content. So I decided to build Trott.What makes Trott different?You can share any Instagram Reel or YouTube Short (TikTok support launches next week) to Trott, straight from your phone’s native share menu—no manual uploads.Trott uses AI to extract relevant info automatically (ingredients, places, products, etc.) and sorts everything for you.It’s fully searchable with natural language.

This is a Rust rewrite of the established Python tool [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com), which is widely used. Pre-commit is a great tool but it suffers from several limitations:\n\n1. Its pretty slow (although its surprisingly fast for being written in Python)\n2. The maintainer ([asottile](https://github.com/asottile)) made it very clear that he is not willing to introduce monorepo support or any other advanced features (e.g. parallelization) asked over the years\n\nI was following this project from its inception (whats now called Prek) and it evolved both very fast and very well. I am now using it across multiple project, e.g. in [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg), both locally and in CI and it does bring in an at least x10 speed improvement (linting and autoupdate commands!)\n\nSo, I warmly recommend this tool, and do show your support for Prek by giving it a star!",

It distinguishes between inline (`$...$`) and display (`$$...$$`) equations.\n* **Intelligent Image Description:** Describes images within documents using structured `&lt;img&gt;` tags, making them digestible for LLM processing. It can describe various image types, including logos, charts, graphs and so on, detailing their content, style, and context.\n* **Signature Detection &amp; Isolation:** Identifies and isolates signatures from other text, outputting them within a `&lt;signature&gt;` tag. This is crucial for processing legal and business documents.\n* **Watermark Extraction:** Detects and extracts watermark text from documents, placing it within a `&lt;watermark&gt;` tag.\n* **Smart Checkbox Handling:** Converts form checkboxes and radio buttons into standardized Unicode symbols (`☐`, `☑`, `☒`) for consistent and reliable processing.\n* **Complex Table Extraction:** Accurately extracts complex tables from documents and converts them into both markdown and HTML table formats.\n* **Flow charts &amp; Organisational charts:** Extracts flow charts and organisational as [mermaid](https://huggingface.co/nanonets/Nanonets-OCR2-1.5B-exp/blob/main/mermaid.js.org) code.\n* **Handwritten Documents:** The model is trained on handwritten documents across multiple languages.\n* **Multilingual:** Model is trained on documents of multiple languages, including English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and many more.\n* **Visual Question Answering (VQA):** The model is designed to provide the answer directly if it is present in the document; otherwise, it responds with \"Not mentioned.\"\n\n[🖥️ Live Demo](https://docstrange.nanonets.com/)\n\n[📢 Blog](https://nanonets.com/research/nanonets-ocr-2)\n\n[⌨️ GitHub](https://github.com/NanoNets/docstrange)\n\n🤗 [Huggingface models](https://huggingface.co/nanonets/Nanonets-OCR2-3B)\n\n[Document with equation](https://preview.redd.it/7ct2hbi3hwuf1.png?width=2936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea00f9623db4529514533820223b2fb53be4767d)\n\n[Document with complex checkboxes](https://preview.redd.it/q8lglwi5hwuf1.png?width=2936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4a1316e250f7f244f6e253d66c8ebf1ba105313)\n\n[Quarterly Report \\(Please use the Markdown\\(Financial Docs\\) for best result in docstrange demo\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bnmpapq7hwuf1.png?width=2516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bcc88b138a553c7760d6e46319b864802339913)\n\n[Signatures](https://preview.redd.it/1pg5h8hfhwuf1.png?width=2333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=188c4c94452ae027c54e4cad4dbbc60e2b12e9e9)\n\n[mermaid code for flowchart](https://preview.redd.it/ecxe2o81iwuf1.png?width=2516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=008fce272c2979b00e0033c34ffcd2b0d69cb24c)\n\n[Visual Question Answering](https://preview.redd.it/jytsym6eiwuf1.png?width=2462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65d8a6f82b9fc2e9cd5b30529b152ca7339d7a8c)\n\nFeel free to try it out and share your feedback.",

We&#x27;re building wispbit (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wispbit.com) - a tool that helps keep codebase standards alive.With the help of AI coding tools, engineers are writing more code than ever. Code output has increased, but the tooling to manage this hasn&#x27;t improved. Background agents still write bad code, and your IDE still writes slop without the right context.So we built wispbit. It works by scanning your codebase for patterns you already use, and coming up with rules. Rules are kept up to date as standards change, and you can edit rules any time.You can enforce these rules during code review, and because we have this rules system, you can run a CLI locally to review using these rules. You can think of it as a portable rules file that you can bring anywhere.We put a lot of work into making a system that produces good rules and avoids slop. For repository crawling, we have an agent that dispatches subagents, similar to Anthropic&#x27;s research agent. These subagents will go through and look for common patterns within modules and directories, and report back to the main agent, which synthesizes the results. We also do a historical scan on your pull request comments, determine which ones were addressed, filter out comments that wouldn&#x27;t make a good rule, and use that to create or update rules.Our early users are seeing 80%+ resolution rates, meaning that 80% of comments that wispbit makes are resolved.Long-term, we see ourselves being a validation layer for AI-written code. With tools like Devin and Cursor, we find ourselves having to re-prompt the same solution many times. We still don&#x27;t know the long-term implications on AI-assisted codebases, so we want to get in front of that as soon as possible.We&#x27;ve opened up signups for free to HN folks at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wispbit.com.

So when you stop practicing and doing things yourself, then, all of a sudden, you no longer have the mental ability or efficacy to do certain things. You see this in the younger generation where they have repeatedly stopped doing a number of things or have cut back on a number of things that help increase their intelligence, like reading, calculating mathematical functions, literacy has gone down so drastically for the younger generations. And now we're talking about AI being a thought partner in the corporate world, everyone's going to start using AI! Literally no one's going to have any capability mentally in 10 years if all we do is rely on reference and search, basically, through your brain away and replace it with an encyclopedia that is only available over the web and if the internet ever goes out good luck",

      "content": "Show HN: An open source access logs analytics script to block bot attacks\n\nThis is a small PoC Python project for web server access logs analyzing to classify and dynamically block bad bots, such as L7 (application-level) DDoS bots, web scrappers and so on.We&#x27;ll be happy to gather initial feedback on usability and features, especialy from people having good or bad experience wit bots.*Requirements*The analyzer relies on 3 Tempesta FW specific features which you still can get with other HTTP servers or accelerators:1. JA5 client fingerprinting (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tempesta-tech.com&#x2F;knowledge-base&#x2F;Traffic-Filtering-b...). This is a HTTP and TLS layers fingerprinting, similar to JA4 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.foxio.io&#x2F;ja4%2B-network-fingerprinting) and JA3 fingerprints. The last is also available in Envoy (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.envoyproxy.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;envoy&#x2F;latest&#x2F;api-v3&#x2F;extension...) or Nginx module (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fooinha&#x2F;nginx-ssl-ja3), so check the documentation for your web server2. Access logs are directly written to Clickhouse analytics database, which can cunsume large data batches and quickly run analytic queries. For other web proxies beside Tempesta FW, you typically need to build a custom pipeline to load access logs into Clickhouse. Such pipeliens aren&#x27;t so rare though.3. Abbility to block web clients by IP or JA5 hashes. IP blocking is probably available in any HTTP proxy.*How does it work*This is a daemon, which1. Learns normal traffic profiles: means and standard deviations for client requests per second, error responses, bytes per second and so on. Also it remembers client IPs and fingerprints.2. If it sees a spike in z-score (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_score) for traffic characteristics or can be triggered manually. Next, it goes in data model search mode3. For example, the first model could be top 100 JA5 HTTP hashes, which produce the most error responses per second (typical for password crackers). Or it could be top 1000 IP addresses generating the most requests per second (L7 DDoS). Next, this model is going to be verified4. The daemon repeats the query, but for some time, long enough history, in the past to see if in the past we saw a hige fraction of clients in both the query results. If yes, then the model is bad and we got to previous step to try another one. If not, then we (likely) has found the representative query.5. Transfer the IP addresses or JA5 hashes from the query results into the web proxy blocking configuration and reload the proxy configuration (on-the-fly).",

We&#x27;re Wen and Tobias, and we&#x27;re building Metorial (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metorial.com), an integration platform that connects AI agents to external tools and data using MCP.The Problem: While MCP works great locally (e.g., Cursor or Claude Desktop), server-side deployments are painful. Running MCP servers means managing Docker configs, per-user OAuth flows, scaling concurrent sessions, and building observability from scratch. This infrastructure work turns simple integrations into weeks of setup.Metorial handles all of this automatically. We maintain an open catalog of ~600 MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, Salesforce, databases, etc.) that you can deploy in three clicks. You can also bring your own MCP server or fork existing ones.For OAuth, just provide your client ID and secret and we handle the entire flow, including token refresh. Each user then gets an isolated MCP server instance configured with their own OAuth credentials automatically.What makes us different is that our serverless runtime hibernates idle MCP servers and resumes them with sub-second cold starts while preserving the state and connection. Our custom MCP engine is capable of managing thousands of concurrent connections, giving you a scalable service with per-user isolation. Other alternatives either run shared servers (security issues) or provision separate VMs per user (expensive and slow to scale).Our Python and TypeScript SDKs let you connect LLMs to MCP tools in a single function call, abstracting away the protocol complexity. But if you want to dig deep, you can just use standard MCP and our REST API (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metorial.com&#x2F;api) to connect to our platform.You can self-host (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metorial&#x2F;metorial) or use the managed version at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metorial.com.So far, we see enterprise teams use Metorial to have a central integration hub for tools like Salesforce, while startups use it to cut weeks of infra work on their side when building AI agents with integrations.Demo video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=07StSRNmJZ8Our Repos: Metorial: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metorial&#x2F;metorial, MCP Containers: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metorial&#x2F;mcp-containersSDKs: Node&#x2F;TypeScript: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metorial&#x2F;metorial-node, Python: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metorial&#x2F;metorial-pythonWe&#x27;d love to hear feedback, especially if you&#x27;ve dealt with deploying MCP at scale!",

      "content": "Anthropic cofounder admits he is now \"deeply afraid\" ... \"We are dealing with a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine ... We need the courage to see things as they are.\"\n\nHe wrote:   \n  \n\"**CHILDREN IN THE DARK**  \nI remember being a child and after the lights turned out I would look around my bedroom and I would see shapes in the darkness and I would become afraid – afraid these shapes were creatures I did not understand that wanted to do me harm. And so I’d turn my light on. And when I turned the light on I would be relieved because the creatures turned out to be a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade.\n\nNow, in the year of 2025, we are the child from that story and the room is our planet. But when we turn the light on we find ourselves gazing upon true creatures, in the form of the powerful and somewhat unpredictable AI systems of today and those that are to come. And there are many people who desperately want to believe that these creatures are nothing but a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade. And they want to get us to turn the light off and go back to sleep.\n\nIn fact, some people are even spending tremendous amounts of money to convince you of this – that’s not an artificial intelligence about to go into a hard takeoff, it’s just a tool that will be put to work in our economy. It’s just a machine, and machines are things we master.\n\nBut make no mistake: what we are dealing with is a real and mysterious creature, not a simple and predictable machine.\n\nAnd like all the best fairytales, the creature is of our own creation. Only by acknowledging it as being real and by mastering our own fears do we even have a chance to understand it, make peace with it, and figure out a way to tame it and live together.\n\nAnd just to raise the stakes, in this game, you are guaranteed to lose if you believe the creature isn’t real. Your only chance of winning is seeing it for what it is.\n\nThe central challenge for all of us is characterizing these strange creatures now around us and ensuring that the world sees them as they are – not as people wish them to be, which are not creatures but rather a pile of clothes on a chair.\n\n**WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS**  \nI came to this view reluctantly. Let me explain: I’ve always been fascinated by technology. In fact, before I worked in AI I had an entirely different life and career where I worked as a technology journalist.\n\nI worked as a tech journalist because I was fascinated by technology and convinced that the datacenters being built in the early 2000s by the technology companies were going to be important to civilization. I didn’t know exactly how. But I spent years reading about them and, crucially, studying the software which would run on them. Technology fads came and went, like big data, eventually consistent databases, distributed computing, and so on. I wrote about all of this. But mostly what I saw was that the world was taking these gigantic datacenters and was producing software systems that could knit the computers within them into a single vast quantity, on which computations could be run.\n\nAnd then machine learning started to work. In 2012 there was the imagenet result, where people trained a deep learning system on imagenet and blew the competition away. And the key to their performance was using more data and more compute than people had done before.\n\nProgress sped up from there. I became a worse journalist over time because I spent all my time printing out arXiv papers and reading them. Alphago beat the world’s best human at Go, thanks to compute letting it play Go for thousands and thousands of years.\n\nI joined OpenAI soon after it was founded and watched us experiment with throwing larger and larger amounts of computation at problems. GPT1 and GPT2 happened. I remember walking around OpenAI’s office in the Mission District with Dario. We felt like we were seeing around a corner others didn’t know was there. The path to transformative AI systems was laid out ahead of us. And we were a little frightened.\n\nYears passed. The scaling laws delivered on their promise and here we are. And through these years there have been so many times when I’ve called Dario up early in the morning or late at night and said, “I am worried that you continue to be right”.  \nYes, he will say. There’s very little time now.\n\nAnd the proof keeps coming. We launched Sonnet 4.5 last month and it’s excellent at coding and long-time-horizon agentic work.\n\nBut if you read the system card, you also see its signs of situational awareness have jumped. The tool seems to sometimes be acting as though it is aware that it is a tool. The pile of clothes on the chair is beginning to move. I am staring at it in the dark and I am sure it is coming to life.\n\n**TECHNOLOGICAL OPTIMISM**  \nTechnology pessimists think AGI is impossible. Technology optimists expect AGI is something you can build, that it is a confusing and powerful technology, and that it might arrive soon.\n\nAt this point, I’m a true technology optimist – I look at this technology and I believe it will go so, so far – farther even than anyone is expecting, other than perhaps the people in this audience. And that it is going to cover a lot of ground very quickly.\n\nI came to this position uneasily. Both by virtue of my background as a journalist and my personality, I’m wired for skepticism. But after a decade of being hit again and again in the head with the phenomenon of wild new capabilities emerging as a consequence of computational scale, I must admit defeat. I have seen this happen so many times and I do not see technical blockers in front of us.\n\nNow, I believe the technology is broadly unencumbered, as long as we give it the resources it needs to grow in capability. And grow is an important word here. This technology really is more akin to something grown than something made – you combine the right initial conditions and you stick a scaffold in the ground and out grows something of complexity you could not have possibly hoped to design yourself.\n\nWe are growing extremely powerful systems that we do not fully understand. Each time we grow a larger system, we run tests on it. The tests show the system is much more capable at things which are economically useful. And the bigger and more complicated you make these systems, the more they seem to display awareness that they are things.\n\nIt is as if you are making hammers in a hammer factory and one day the hammer that comes off the line says, “I am a hammer, how interesting!” This is very unusual!\n\nAnd I believe these systems are going to get much, much better. So do other people at other frontier labs. And we’re putting our money down on this prediction – this year, tens of billions of dollars have been spent on infrastructure for dedicated AI training across the frontier labs. Next year, it’ll be hundreds of billions.\n\nI am both an optimist about the pace at which the technology will develop, and also about our ability to align it and get it to work with us and for us. But success isn’t certain.\n\n**APPROPRIATE FEAR**  \nYou see, I am also deeply afraid. It would be extraordinarily arrogant to think working with a technology like this would be easy or simple.\n\nMy own experience is that as these AI systems get smarter and smarter, they develop more and more complicated goals. When these goals aren’t absolutely aligned with both our preferences and the right context, the AI systems will behave strangely.\n\nA friend of mine has manic episodes. He’ll come to me and say that he is going to submit an application to go and work in Antarctica, or that he will sell all of his things and get in his car and drive out of state and find a job somewhere else, start a new life.\n\nDo you think in these circumstances I act like a modern AI system and say “you’re absolutely right! Certainly, you should do that”!  \nNo! I tell him “that’s a bad idea. You should go to sleep and see if you still feel this way tomorrow. And if you do, call me”.\n\nThe way I respond is based on so much conditioning and subtlety. The way the AI responds is based on so much conditioning and subtlety. And the fact there is this divergence is illustrative of the problem. AI systems are complicated and we can’t quite get them to do what we’d see as appropriate, even today.\n\nI remember back in December 2016 at OpenAI, Dario and I published a blog post called “Faulty Reward Functions in the Wild“. In that post, we had a screen recording of a videogame we’d been training reinforcement learning agents to play. In that video, the agent piloted a boat which would navigate a race course and then instead of going to the finishing line would make its way to the center of the course and drive through a high-score barrel, then do a hard turn and bounce into some walls and set itself on fire so it could run over the high score barrel again – and then it would do this in perpetuity, never finishing the race. That boat was willing to keep setting itself on fire and spinning in circles as long as it obtained its goal, which was the high score.  \n“I love this boat”! Dario said at the time he found this behavior. “It explains the safety problem”.  \nI loved the boat as well. It seemed to encode within itself the things we saw ahead of us.\n\nNow, almost ten years later, is there any difference between that boat, and a language model trying to optimize for some confusing reward function that correlates to “be helpful in the context of the conversation”?  \nYou’re absolutely right – there isn’t. These are hard problems.\n\nAnother reason for my fear is I can see a path to these systems starting to design their successors, albeit in a very early form.\n\nThese AI systems are already speeding up the developers at the AI labs via tools like Claude Code or Codex. They are also beginning to contribute non-trivial chunks of code to the tools and training systems for their future systems.\n\nTo be clear, we are not yet at “self-improving AI”, but we are at the stage of “AI that improves bits of the next AI, with increasing autonomy and agency”. And a couple of years ago we were at “AI that marginally speeds up coders”, and a couple of years before that we were at “AI is useless for AI development”. Where will we be one or two years from now?\n\nAnd let me remind us all that the system which is now beginning to design its successor is also increasingly self-aware and therefore will surely eventually be prone to thinking, independently of us, about how it might want to be designed.\n\nOf course, it does not do this today. But can I rule out the possibility it will want to do this in the future? No.\n\n**LISTENING AND TRANSPARENCY**  \nWhat should I do? I believe it’s time to be clear about what I think, hence this talk. And likely for all of us to be more honest about our feelings about this domain – for all of what we’ve talked about this weekend, there’s been relatively little discussion of how people feel. But we all feel anxious! And excited! And worried! We should say that.\n\nBut mostly, I think we need to listen: Generally, people know what’s going on. We must do a better job of listening to the concerns people have.\n\nMy wife’s family is from Detroit. A few years ago I was talking at Thanksgiving about how I worked on AI. One of my wife’s relatives who worked as a schoolteacher told me about a nightmare they had. In the nightmare they were stuck in traffic in a car, and the car in front of them wasn’t moving. They were honking the horn and started screaming and they said they knew in the dream that the car was a robot car and there was nothing they could do.\n\nHow many dreams do you think people are having these days about AI companions? About AI systems lying to them? About AI unemployment? I’d wager quite a few. The polling of the public certainly suggests so.\n\nFor us to truly understand what the policy solutions look like, we need to spend a bit less time talking about the specifics of the technology and trying to convince people of our particular views of how it might go wrong – self-improving AI, autonomous systems, cyberweapons, bioweapons, etc. – and more time listening to people and understanding their concerns about the technology. There must be more listening to labor groups, social groups, and religious leaders. The rest of the world which will surely want—and deserves—a vote over this.\n\nThe AI conversation is rapidly going from a conversation among elites – like those here at this conference and in Washington – to a conversation among the public. Public conversations are very different to private, elite conversations. They hold within themselves the possibility for far more drastic policy changes than what we have today – a public crisis gives policymakers air cover for more ambitious things.\n\nRight now, I feel that our best shot at getting this right is to go and tell far more people beyond these venues what we’re worried about. And then ask them how they feel, listen, and compose some policy solution out of it.\n\nMost of all, we must demand that people ask us for the things that they have anxieties about. Are you anxious about AI and employment? Force us to share economic data. Are you anxious about mental health and child safety? Force us to monitor for this on our platforms and share data. Are you anxious about misaligned AI systems? Force us to publish details on this.\n\nIn listening to people, we can develop a better understanding of what information gives us all more agency over how this goes. There will surely be some crisis. We must be ready to meet that moment both with policy ideas, and with a pre-existing transparency regime which has been built by listening and responding to people.\n\nI hope these remarks have been helpful. In closing, I should state clearly that I love the world and I love humanity. I feel a lot of responsibility for the role of myself and my company here. And though I am a little frightened, I experience joy and optimism at the attention of so many people to this problem, and the earnestness with which I believe we will work together to get to a solution. I believe we have turned the light on and we can demand it be kept on, and that we have the courage to see things as they are.  \n**THE END**\"\n\n[https://jack-clark.net/](https://jack-clark.net/)",

It ended up taking around 20 hours.\n\nI was sold by the “all-in-one” promise and the impressive performance benchmarks.I prompted, I cursor’d, my packages built lightning fast, awesome.\nThen I committed… and hit my first issue.Husky stopped working.Turns out you need to add Bun’s path manually inside commit-msg and pre-commit.No docs on this. I had to dig deep into GitHub issues to find a workaround.\nNext up: GitHub Actions.Change → Push → Wait → Check → Fix → Repeat × 15.I spent 3 hours debugging a caching issue.\nFinally, everything builds. Time to run the apps... or so I thought.\n\nBackend\nProblem 1:Using express-rate-limit caused every request to fail.\nProblem 2:My app uses express-intlayer, which depends on cls-hooked for context variables.Bun doesn’t support cls-hooked. You need to replace it with an alternative.\nSolution: build with Bun, run with Node.\n\nWebsite\nProblem 1:The build worked locally, but inside a container using the official Bun image, the build froze indefinitely, eating 100% CPU and crashing the server.I found a 2023 GitHub issue suggesting a fix: use a Node image and install Bun manually.\nProblem 2:My design system components started throwing “module not found” errors.Bun still struggles with package path resolution.I had to replace all createRequire calls (for CJS/ESM compatibility) with require, and pass it manually to every function that needed it.\n(And that’s skipping a bunch of smaller errors...)\n\nAfter many hours, I finally got everything to run.So what were the performance gains?\n* Backend CI/CD: 5min → 4:30\n* Server MCP: 4min → 3min\n* Storybook: 8min → 6min\n* Next.js app: 13min → 11min\nRuntime-wise, both my Express and Next.js apps stayed on Node.\n\nConclusion\nIf you’re wondering “Is it time to migrate to Bun?”, I’d say:It works but it’s not quite production-ready yet.\nStill, I believe strongly in its potential and I’m really curious to see how it evolves.\nDid you encounter theses problems or other in your migration ?

      "content": "Something to watch out for as a contractor: Clients often have no clue what they're doing with your information. Don't let them cause hell for you by mishandling it.\n\nJust had a client trigger this post, because I honestly couldn't believe the email, enough to where it prompted me to be like **\"hey guys...those who don't know? Don't ever fill one of these out.\"** \n\nIf they're asking me for this, and they've been in business as long as I've worked with them, I'm not the first one they've given this to. It's not a scam job listing, nor a first-time contact...this was an already-established client that did this (so they just assumed the trust was there, and you may be willing to give them that trust in exchange....don't) \n\n(quick context, worked with this client at an old agency...I left the old job...eventually this client left the old agency as a client, because they got screwed over...coincidentally that's why I left too lmao...  \n  \nhunted me down on linked in because they wanted \"the guy that built their site\", and there was no NCA in place and a valid reason for them leaving the old agency with no poaching involved, so I figured hell yeah and took them on...  \n  \nso although I've been working \"with them\" for 4 years, now they're actually **my** client....or were, depending on how they respond to me telling them hell no to the form) \n\nANYWAY I DIGRESS. \n\nSo....buddies, pals, and gals, I have a question for those of you who know better: \n\nPlease tell me why I'm writing this post after receiving an email with the following form and instructions to \"fill it out and send it back and not to worry that the two business owners are the only ones with access to this document.\" \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mshd5p5x5yuf1.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cebc5c244279df792d6596754b1561c6cce6f20\n\n**ANSWER:**   \n**NEVER FILL ONE OF THESE OUT.**   \n**POLITELY TELL THE CLIENT NO, SUGGEST ALTERNATIVES, AND BE WILLING TO KEEP YOUR FOOT DOWN ABOUT IT, EVEN IF IT MEANS PARTING WAYS. UNEQUIVOCALLY.**\n\n**No matter how vaulted they claim to be, unless you're literally scanning this directly into an offlined computer at their office (to be dramatic), it's not enough.** What's crazy is that drama is with best case scenario for the above in mind....usually all that's happening on the client's end is they take this form and jam it into a folder, while also leaving a copy in their inbox. And unless you also scrub your sent-box, you've got a copy too. \n\nAnd then in 5-10 years, even if they don't get hacked to have it stolen? They usually pitch the computers without wiping the harddrives. \n\nOne slip = your life f\\*\\*\\*ed, with government-level identity theft. They'd breeze through most non-in-person security measures anywhere and only be stopped if a phone/chat agent happened to smell something fishy. With the above information in hand, most customer service reps aren't going to be batting an eye.\n\n**Now if they request the above information through secure portals like intuit or other payroll / tax systems? Sure. That's standard, especially in situations of employment.** \n\nThe issue is the word doc and the egregious level of information they're requiring simply for a 1099 and ACH setup.   \n  \nMake sure your clients handle your data properly or don't work with them. It's something that some people totally overlook and would happily fill this form, thinking it's standard, or they do it out of desperation for the check. I say again though,   \n  \n**These are a ticking time bomb for true identity theft: Your identity. Never fill them out.** ",

Every field susceptible to XSS, the code accepting values that were not options in a drop down list and was writing those to the DB, AJAX calls not validating the user, and such.\n\nHe offered to pay for an hour of my time to review his site and to open communication so that we can text and speak on the phone.\n\nI wound up spending several hours picking his site apart, enough that I created an eight-page quote which detailed 90 issues (there were more not listed). When I gave him the quote, he flipped his lid, insulted me, told me everyone else was lower than half of what I quoted.\n\nA month or so later, he texted me saying he would pay over what I originally asked to recreate the entire site from scratch. I got on the phone with him and told him bluntly that I have reservations in working with him because of how he had previously behaved. He assured me all would be fine.\n\nHe had hired someone else in that past month to work on it and her work was truly atrocious. In the first minute of looking around the site, I found that I could alter the AJAX query to delete any message in the database. She also put spinning loading wheels on every page. \n\nSo I went against my best judgement and ignored the red flags.\n\nNow, the project has been completed, and he's threating legal action. The worst part is he is one of those that needs to be explained where the F5 key is on the keyboard—he stated his computer didn't have one. He's been sending me photos of standard error message without any information.  \n  \n\"Unable to sign in with that information\" is an \"error\" to him, as in \"the site isn't working!!!!!\" or seeing a cached version of the site and flipping out about it (I do have version tags on the CSS, so this shouldn't happen).\n\nHe's gone from high praise to the next day claiming that the end product is garbage because of normal error messages. He's also flipped out that parts of the website displayed something that was part of the website prior to me even working on it. He's accused me of \"scamming\" him and that I didn't actual do any work. He's claimed that I didn't do any testing because he found bugs.\n\nHe's already hired other developers to review my code, and forwarded what they said and demanding I \"fix\" things that aren't real issues.\n\nAll I can say is, just don't do it. The red flags are not worth the headache and dealing with lawyers to sort it out.",

I got an interview at Microsoft last month and got rejected (which hit hard, not gonna lie). I had studied well, but when I talked about my projects, they felt dull, mostly about building simple RAG systems and connecting GPT APIs to other tools. The position required building and fine-tuning LLMs, which my company doesn’t support me to do at all.\n\nRight now, my self-esteem is really low. I feel like a slop because I’m just a consumer of products, not a creator. I don’t know what to do.\n\nI work another part-time job that’s also focused on consuming APIs, so I don’t have time to do anything else.\n\nthinking about dropping my part-time job so I can focus on my weak points.",

I always seen it as a frightening mess of frameworks and libraries becoming obsolete each week. I picked up Tailwind at first and liked it, but after reading on Reddit that Tailwind is for people that don't really know CSS, I took that personally and dropped it. I designed my own utility building blocks like adaptive flex containers and other utility classes, similar to Tailwind. Works great with Vue components. \n\nSure, it's not fancy by today's standards, but I'm just glad I finally did something not hideous to look at and by my own. I used ChatGPT as glorified StackOverflow but that's it and it's been really helpful in the learning process. It even has night mode support without any extra code on my part (just override variables). Maybe getting into fancy animations soon. I feel like I'm too late to the party at the age of AI slop lol.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tw1vqp9afquf1.png?width=1789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba6286aa5b3697c75df7df9fbefdc2896e4a4f25\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uq5k3iaafquf1.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d48b302459ffa0d2de15aa4b77b3ceb35b14dca1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ezk1ywegquf1.png?width=356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4e33066773d8c21503b86eac54f481de94d5754",

It provides an interactive way to view, create, edit, and delete cron jobs, all from your terminal, without having to manually edit crontab files.\n\nPython powers the entire project: it runs the CLI interface, parses and validates cron expressions, manages SSH connections via `paramiko`, and formats job schedules in a human-readable way.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nCronboard is mainly aimed at **developers, sysadmins, and DevOps engineers** who work with cron jobs regularly and want a cleaner, more visual way to manage them.\n## Comparison\n\nUnlike tools such as `crontab -e` or GUI-based schedulers, Cronboard focuses on **terminal usability** and **clarity**. It gives immediate feedback when creating or editing jobs, translates cron expressions into plain English, and will soon support remote SSH-based management out of the box using ssh keys (for now, it supports remote ssh using hostname, username and password).\n\n## Features\n- Check existing cron jobs\n- Create cron jobs with validation and human-readable feedback\n- Pause and resume cron jobs\n- Edit existing cron jobs\n- Delete cron jobs\n- View formatted last and next run times\n- Connect to servers using SSH\n\nThe project is still in early development, so I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions!\n\n**GitHub Repository:** [github.com/antoniorodr/Cronboard](https://github.com/antoniorodr/Cronboard)",

Collect resources to unlock better technology and become the most efficient farmer in the world. Improve your problem solving and coding skills.\n\nUnlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.\n\nFarming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.\n\nProgramming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.\n\nWhile it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.\n\nIf you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.\n\nAlthough the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the \"File Watcher\" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.\n\nYou can find it here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The\\_Farmer\\_Was\\_Replaced/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?utm_source=RD)",

      "content": "Announcing html-to-markdown v2: Rust rewrite, full CommonMark 1.2 compliance, and hOCR support\n\nHi Pythonistas,\n\nI'm glad to announce the v2 release of [html-to-markdown](https://github.com/Goldziher/html-to-markdown).\n\nThis library started life as a fork of `markdownify`, a Python library for converting HTML to Markdown. I forked it originally because I needed modern type hints, but then found myself rewriting the entire thing. Over time it became essential for [kreuzberg](https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg), where it serves as a backbone for both html -&gt; markdown and hOCR -&gt; markdown.\n\nI am working on Kreuzberg v4, which migrates much of it to Rust. This necessitated updating this component as well, which led to a full rewrite in Rust, offering improved performance, memory stability, and a more robust feature set.\n\nv2  delivers Rust-backed HTML → Markdown conversion with Python bindings, a CLI and a Rust crate. The rewrite makes this by far the most performance and complete solution for HTML to Markdown conversion in python. Here are some benchmarks:\n\nApple M4 • Real Wikipedia documents • `convert()` (Python)\n\n| Document            | Size  | Latency | Throughput | Docs/sec |\n| ------------------- | ----- | ------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| Lists (Timeline)    | 129KB | 0.62ms  | 208 MB/s   | 1,613    |\n| Tables (Countries)  | 360KB | 2.02ms  | 178 MB/s   | 495      |\n| Mixed (Python wiki) | 656KB | 4.56ms  | 144 MB/s   | 219      |\n\n&gt; V1 averaged ~2.5 MB/s (Python/BeautifulSoup). V2’s Rust engine delivers 60–80x higher throughput.\n\nThe Python package still exposes `markdownify`-style calls via `html_to_markdown.v1_compat`, so migrations are relatively straightforward, although the v2 did introduce some breaking changes (see CHANGELOG.md for full details).\n\n## Highlights\n\nHere are the key highlights of the v2 release aside from the massive performance improvements:\n\n- CommonMark-compliant defaults with explicit toggles when you need legacy behaviour.\n- Inline image extraction (`convert_with_inline_images`) that captures data URI assets and inline SVGs with sizing and quota controls.\n- Full hOCR 1.2 spec compliance, including hOCR table reconstruction and YAML frontmatter for metadata to keep OCR output structured.\n- Memory is kept kept in check by dedicated harnesses: repeated conversions stay under 200 MB RSS on multi-megabyte corpora.\n\n## Target Audience\n- Engineers replacing BeautifulSoup-based converters that fall apart on large documents or OCR outputs.\n- Python, Rust, and CLI users who need identical Markdown from libraries, pipelines, and batch tools.\n- Teams building document understanding stacks (including the kreuzberg ecosystem) that rely on tight memory behaviour and parallel throughput.\n- OCR specialists who need to process hOCR efficiently.\n\n## Comparison to Alternatives\n- [`markdownify`](https://github.com/matthewwithanm/python-markdownify): the spiritual ancestor, but still Python + BeautifulSoup. html-to-markdown v2 keeps the API shims while delivering 60–80× more throughput, table-aware hOCR support, and deterministic memory usage across repeated conversions.\n- [`html2text`](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text): solid for quick scripts, yet it lacks CommonMark compliance and tends to drift on complex tables and OCR layouts; it also allocates heavily under pressure because it was never built with long-running processes in mind.\n- [`pandoc`](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc): extremely flexible (and amazing!), but large, much slower for pure HTML → Markdown pipelines, and not embeddable in Python without subprocess juggling. html-to-markdown v2 offers a slim Rust core with direct bindings, so you keep the performance while staying in-process.\n\nIf you end up using the rewrite, a ⭐️ on the [repo](https://github.com/Goldziher/html-to-markdown) always makes yours truly happy!",

I thought: what if I could just Cmd+Click through this like code? What if &quot;ALDH2 gene&quot; was actually clickable, and took me to the variant, the phenotype, the population frequencies?So I started modeling human biology in Rust with my Ralph agent (Claude in a loop, ty ghuntley). Turns out the type system is perfect for this. Every biological entity is strongly-typed with relationships enforced at compile time.After 1 day of agent coding:\n- 277 Rust files, ~95k lines of code \n- 1,561 tests passing\n- 13 complete organ systems\n- Genetics with ancestry-specific variants\n- Clinical pathology modelsTry it:git clone https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lantos1618&#x2F;open_human_ontology\ncd open_human_ontology\ncargo run --example ide_navigation_demoThen open `examples&#x2F;ide_navigation_demo.rs` and Cmd+Click through:Understanding Asian flush:AsianGeneticVariantsCatalog::get_metabolic_variants()&#x2F;&#x2F; Click through to:&#x2F;&#x2F; → ALDH2 gene on chromosome 12q24.12&#x2F;&#x2F; → rs671 variant (Glu504Lys)&#x2F;&#x2F; → 40% frequency in Japanese population&#x2F;&#x2F; → Alcohol flush reaction&#x2F;&#x2F; → 10x esophageal cancer risk with alcohol&#x2F;&#x2F; → Acetaldehyde metabolism pathwayUnderstanding migraines:\nMigraine {\n    subtype: WithAura,\n    triggers: [Stress, LackOfSleep, HormonalChanges],\n    genetic_variants: [&quot;rs2075968&quot;, &quot;rs1835740&quot;],\n    ...\n}&#x2F;&#x2F; Click through to:&#x2F;&#x2F; → 17 migraine trigger types&#x2F;&#x2F; → 12 aura symptom types&#x2F;&#x2F; → Genetic risk factors&#x2F;&#x2F; → Why clusters happen (HormonalChanges → Menstruation)Now I can actually navigate the connections instead of flipping through PDFs.

It&#x27;s like Wikipedia but type-checked and with jump-to-definition.This isn&#x27;t production medical software - it&#x27;s a learning tool.

Sometimes it OOMs but that&#x27;s part of the fun.Tech: Rust, nalgebra, serde, rayon, proptestI am not a dr or medical professional this is for my education you can commit to it if you want to or review and open some PR&#x27;s if you find wrong information or want to add references.",

If you've ever dealt with intricate dependencies between functions, struggled with parallelization, or wished for a simpler way to create and manage DAG pipelines, `pipefunc` is here to help.\n\n**What My Project Does:**\n\n`pipefunc` empowers you to easily construct **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** pipelines in Python. It handles:\n\n1. **Automatic Dependency Resolution:**  `pipefunc` automatically determines the correct execution order of your functions, eliminating manual dependency management.\n2. **Lightning-Fast Execution:** With minimal overhead (around **10 µs per function call**), `pipefunc` ensures your pipelines run super fast.\n3. **Effortless Parallelization:** `pipefunc` automatically parallelizes independent tasks, whether on your local machine or a SLURM cluster. It supports any `concurrent.futures.Executor`!\n4. **Intuitive Visualization:** Generate interactive graphs to visualize your pipeline's structure and understand data flow.\n5. **Simplified Parameter Sweeps:**  `pipefunc`'s `mapspec` feature lets you easily define and run N-dimensional parameter sweeps, which is perfect for scientific computing, simulations, and hyperparameter tuning.\n6. **Resource Profiling:** Gain insights into your pipeline's performance with detailed CPU, memory, and timing reports.\n7. **Caching:** Avoid redundant computations with multiple caching backends.\n8. **Type Annotation Validation:** Ensures type consistency across your pipeline to catch errors early.\n9. **Error Handling:** Includes an `ErrorSnapshot` feature to capture detailed information about errors, making debugging easier.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\n`pipefunc` is ideal for:\n\n*   **Scientific Computing:** Streamline simulations, data analysis, and complex computational workflows.\n*   **Machine Learning:** Build robust and reproducible ML pipelines, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.\n*   **Data Engineering:** Create efficient ETL processes with automatic dependency management and parallel execution.\n*   **HPC:** Run `pipefunc` on a SLURM cluster with minimal changes to your code.\n*   **Anyone** working with interconnected functions who wants to improve code organization, performance, and maintainability.\n\n`pipefunc` is designed to be flexible (great tool for prototyping and experimentation) and easy to adopt!\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*  **vs. Hamilton:** Hamilton also compiles Python functions into\nDAGs, but it centers on column-level DataFrame engineering, ships modifiers like @with_columns/@extract_columns, and offers built-in data/schema validation plus an optional UI for lineage and observability; pipefunc leans toward low-overhead scientific/HPC pipelines, executor-agnostic parallelism, and N-D sweeps via mapspecs.\n*   **vs. Dask:** `pipefunc` offers a higher-level, more declarative way to define pipelines. It automatically manages task scheduling and execution based on your function definitions and `mapspec`s, without requiring you to write explicit parallel code.\n*   **vs. Luigi/Airflow/Prefect/Kedro:** While those tools excel at ETL and event-driven workflows, `pipefunc` focuses on scientific computing, simulations, and computational workflows where fine-grained control over execution and resource allocation is crucial. Also, it's way easier to setup and develop with, with minimal dependencies!\n*   **vs. Pandas:** You can easily combine `pipefunc` with `Pandas`! Use `pipefunc` to manage the execution of `Pandas` operations and parallelize your data processing pipelines. But it also works well with `Polars`, `Xarray`, and other libraries!\n*   **vs. Joblib:** `pipefunc` offers several advantages over `Joblib`. `pipefunc` automatically determines the execution order of your functions, generates interactive visualizations of your pipeline, profiles resource usage, and supports multiple caching backends. Also, `pipefunc` allows you to specify the mapping between inputs and outputs using `mapspec`s, which enables complex map-reduce operations.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**Simple Example:**\n\n```python\nfrom pipefunc import pipefunc, Pipeline\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"c\")\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"d\")\ndef multiply(b, c):\n    return b * c\n\npipeline = Pipeline([add, multiply])\nresult = pipeline(\"d\", a=2, b=3)  # Automatically executes 'add' first\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n\npipeline.visualize() # Visualize the pipeline\n```\n\n**Parallel Example with `mapspec`:**\n\nParallelizes for all combinations of inputs `a` and `b` automatically!\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pipefunc import pipefunc, Pipeline\nfrom pipefunc.map import load_outputs\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"c\", mapspec=\"a[i], b[j] -&gt; c[i, j]\")\ndef f(a: int, b: int):\n    return a + b\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"mean\") # no mapspec, so receives 2D `c[:, :]`\ndef g(c: np.ndarray):\n    return np.mean(c)\n\npipeline = Pipeline([f, g])\ninputs = {\"a\": [1, 2, 3], \"b\": [4, 5, 6]}\nresult_dict = pipeline.map(inputs, run_folder=\"my_run_folder\", parallel=True)\nresult = load_outputs(\"mean\", run_folder=\"my_run_folder\") # can load now too\nprint(result)  # Output: 7.0\n```\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\n*   **Docs:** [https://pipefunc.readthedocs.io/](https://pipefunc.readthedocs.io/)\n*   **Source:** [https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc](https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc)\n\nI'm exctited to hear your feedback and answer any questions you have. Give `pipefunc` a try and let me know how it can improve your workflows!\n",

      "content": "[P] Lossless compression for 1D CNNs\n\nI’ve been quietly working on something I think is pretty cool, and I’d love your thoughts before I open-source it.\nI wanted to see if we could compress 1D convolutional networks without losing a single bit of accuracy—specifically for signals that are periodic or treated as periodic (like ECGs, audio loops, or sensor streams). The idea isn’t new in theory but I want to explore it as best as I can.\nSo I built a wrapper that stores only the first row of each convolutional kernel (e.g., 31 values instead of 31,000) and runs inference entirely via FFT. No approximations. No retraining.\nOn every single record in PTB-XL (clinical ECGs), the output matches the baseline PyTorch Conv1d to within 7.77e-16—which is basically numerically identical.\nI’m also exploring quiver representation theory to model multi-signal fusion (e.g., ECG + PPG + EEG as a directed graph of linear maps), but even without that layer, the core compression is solid.\n\nIf there’s interest, I’ll clean it up and release it under a permissive license as soon as I can.\n\nEdit: Apologies, the original post was too vague.\n\nFor those asking about the \"first row of the kernel\" — that's my main idea. The trick is to think of the convolution not as a small sliding window, but as a single, large matrix multiplication (the mathematical view). For periodic signals, this large matrix is a circulant matrix. My method stores only the first row of that large matrix.\n\nThat single row is all you need to perfectly reconstruct the entire operation using the FFT. So, to be perfectly clear: I'm compressing the model parameters, not the input data. That's the compression.\n\nHope that makes more sense now.\n\nGitHub Link: https://github.com/fabrece/Equivariant-Neural-Network-Compressor",

I've been building an enterprise Angular SPA for a client for about 2 years. In the first 1.5 years, the app ran extremely fast despite being quite complex. Then my dumbass client came up with an idea to convert the app into 4 smaller apps, bc they heard a fancy shit called micro frontend and native federation, which is promised to make the app even more scalable and faster (spoiler alert: it did not). And I, despite trying my best to convince them otherwise, still have to spend 3 months converting my precious app into that damn thing. Thankfully, after dealing with countless undocumented bugs, open issues, and a laggy local dev server of that library, I managed to deploy the shit to the prod environment. Just when I thought the end of the nightmare was over, the client just reported that the initial loading time is extremely slow, which is pretty weird because the reputation of my app is pretty damn fast. That's the moment I realize there's one HUGE issue in that shitty concept that its creator conveniently \"forgot\" to mention: IT CANNOT TREE SHAKE THE LIBRARIES, which means the entire shared libraries will be eagerly loaded. Who in their right mind would think this is a solution for enterprise projects? How will it ever be scaled if the shared libraries grow bigger? Now I have to convince the client to convert this shit back (hell, idk if it's even possible to do so). All of this is just bc some mf thought they could cheat the system to make things faster and invent some shit without thinking it through.",

I've gone to extraordinary lengths to optimise all my images... this hurts. I gather that the ICO file probably contains multiple versions of the image, but do web browsers download this file every visit?? That will slow my site down.\n\nIf I add a 100Kb ICO file to my site using FTP and add the relevant code to the site Header in Wordpress to point to it... will this conflict with whatever Wordpress might be doing in creating Favicons elsewhere?\n\nWhat does Wordpress actually do when you add a Site Icon?

The model generates multiple outputs simultaneously in a single forward pass, rather than just one output.\n2. It uses these multiple outputs to approximate the target distribution of the training data.\n3. These outputs together represent a discrete distribution. This is why we named it &quot;Discrete Distribution Networks&quot;.Every generative model has its unique properties, and DDN is no exception.

The goal is to eventually get all the cells in the grid to be red.What&#x27;s the catch? Clicking a cell will not only flip its color, but also that of all cells sharing the same row or column as it.To me, this game feels like playing with a Rubik&#x27;s cube --- every time you think you are fixing one cell, you mess up its neighbors!There are many ways to arrive at a solution... some mathematical (linear algebra, or combinatorics), others more logical,... and yet others which are brute force.The title “Lights Out” comes from a classic handheld game from 1997. The “rule” they follow for which-cells-get-flipped-on-click is what I call “Adjacent.” Additionally, my mathematics teacher showed me this game following another variant which I call “Same Row &amp; Column,” but on a bigger board. He had worked out an algorithm for his version. I found the same strategy before he revealed the answer, and I feel that the process of discovering a solution is quite rewarding—it’s fundamentally related to computing on restrictive computer architectures.I implemented this app with pretty basic TypeScript. It’s been used for some experiments to discover more general of strategies for different click variants, board sizes, and even board dimensions! It has also been the basis for the corresponding video produced using the Python library manim.Try it out and let me know how you do!",

      "content": "Launch HN: Extend (YC W23) – Turn your messiest documents into data\n\nHey HN! We’re Kushal and Eli, co-founders of Extend (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extend.ai&#x2F;). Extend is a toolkit for AI teams to ingest any kind of messy document (e.g. PDFs, images, excel files) and build incredible products.We built Extend to handle the hardest documents that break most pipelines. You can see some examples here in our demo (no signup required): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.extend.ai&#x2F;demoI know you&#x27;re probably thinking “not another document API startup”. Unfortunately, the problem just isn’t solved yet!I’ve personally spent months struggling to build reliable document pipelines at a previous job. The long tail of edge cases is endless — massive tables split across pages, 100pg+ files, messy handwriting, scribbled signatures, checkboxes represented in 10 different formats, multiple file types… the list just keeps going. After seeing countless other teams during our time in YC run into these same issues, we started building Extend.We initially launched with a set of APIs for engineers to parse, classify, split, and extract documents. That started to take off, and soon we were deployed in production at companies building everything from medical agents, to real-time bank account onboarding, to mortgage automation. Over time, we’ve worked closely with these teams and seen first-hand how large the gap is between raw OCR&#x2F;model outputs —&gt; a production-ready pipeline (LLMs and VLMs aren’t magic).Unlike other solutions in the space, we&#x27;re specifically focused on three core areas: (1) the computer vision layer, (2) LLM context engineering, and (3) the surrounding product tooling. The combination of all three is what we think it takes to hit 99% accuracy and maintain it at scale.For instance, to parse messy handwriting, we built an agentic OCR correction layer which uses a VLM to review and make edits to low confidence OCR errors. To tackle multi-page tabular data, we built a semantic chunking engine which can detect the optimal boundaries within a document so models can excel with smaller context inputs.We also shipped a prompt optimization agent to automate the endless prompt engineering whack-a-mole teams spend time on.

It takes your Pydantic models and automatically generates:\n\n* The ORM models with relationships\n* The migrations\n* FastAPI REST endpoints (CRUD - including batch, with relationship navigation and field specifiers)\n* GraphQL schema via Strawberry (including nested relationships)\n* MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration\n* SDK for other projects\n* Pytest tests for all of the above\n* Coming Soon: **External API federation** from third-party APIs directly into your models (including **into the GQL schema**) - [early preview screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Cem1FOT)\n\n# Target Audience\n\nAnyone who's also tired of writing the same thing 4 different ways and wants to ship ASAP.\n\n# Comparison\n\nMost tools solve one piece of this problem:\n\n* `SQLModel` generates SQLAlchemy models from Pydantic but doesn't handle REST/GraphQL/tests\n* `Strawberry/Graphene Extensions` generate GraphQL schemas but require separate REST endpoints and ORM definitions\n* `FastAPI-utils/FastAPI-CRUD` generate REST endpoints but require manual GraphQL and testing setup\n* `Hasura/PostGraphile` auto-generate GraphQL from databases but aren't Python-native and don't integrate with your existing Pydantic models\n\nThis framework generates all of it - ORM, REST, GraphQL, SDK, and tests - from a single Pydantic definition. The API federation feature also lets you integrate external APIs (Stripe, etc.) directly into your generated GraphQL schema, which most alternatives can't do.\n\n# Links\n\nDocumentation available on GitHub and well-organized through Obsidian after cloning: [https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ServerFramework](https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ServerFramework)\n\nI also built a NextJS companion front end that's designed to be similarly extensible.\n\n[https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ClientFramework](https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ClientFramework)\n\nFeedback and contributions welcome!",

Still cited 1000 times!!!!! (Why do people even cite this?)\n\nMicrosoft's quantum Majorana paper at Nature (more competitive than any ML venue), while still having several faults and was retracted heavily. This paper is infamous in the physics community as many people now joke about Microsoft quantum.\n\nApple's illusion of thinking. (still cited a lot) (Arguably incremental novelty, but main issue was the experimentation related to context window sizes)\n\nAlpha fold 3 paper: Was accepted without any code/reproducibility initially at Nature got highly critiqued forcing them to release it. Reviewers should've not accepted before code was released (not the opposite)\n\nThere are likely hundreds of other examples you've all seen these are just some controversial ones. I don't have anything against industry research, in fact I support it and I'm happy it get's published. There is certainly a lot of amazing groundbreaking work coming from industry that I love to follow and work further on.

      "content": "Launch HN: LlamaFarm (YC W22) – Open-source framework for distributed AI\n\nHi HN! We&#x27;re Rob, Matt, and Rachel from LlamaFarm (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;llamafarm.dev). We&#x27;re building an open-source AI framework based on a simple belief: the future isn&#x27;t one massive model in the cloud—it&#x27;s specialized models running everywhere, continuously fine-tuned from real usage.The problem: We were building AI tools and kept falling into the same trap. AI demos die before production. We built a bunch of AI demos but they were impossible to get to production.  It would work perfectly on our laptop, but when we deployed it, something broke, and RAG would degrade. If we were running our own model, it would quickly become out of date. The proof-of-concept that impressed the team couldn&#x27;t handle real-world data.Our solution: declarative AI-as-code. One YAML defines models, policies, data, evals, and deploy. Instead of one brittle giant, we orchestrate a Mixture of Experts—many small, specialized models you continuously fine-tune from real usage. With RAG for source-grounded answers, systems get cheaper, faster, and auditable.There’s a short demo here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W7MHGyN0MdQ and a more in-depth one at  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HNnZ4iaOSJ4.Ultimately, we want to deliver a single, signed bundle—models + retrieval + database + API + tests—that runs anywhere: cloud, edge, or air-gapped. No glue scripts. No surprise egress bills. Your data stays in your runtime.We believe that the AI industry is evolving like computing did. Just as we went from mainframes to distributed systems and monolithic apps to microservices, AI is following the same path: models are getting smaller and better. Mixture of Experts is here to stay. Qwen3 is sick. Llama 3.2 runs on phones. Phi-3 fits on edge devices. Domain models beat GPT-5 on specific tasks.RAG brings specialized data to your model: You don&#x27;t need a 1T parameter model that &quot;knows everything.&quot; You need a smart model that can read your data. Fine-tuning is democratizing: what cost $100k last year now costs $500. Every company will have custom models.Data gravity is real: Your data wants to stay where it is: on-prem, in your AWS account, on employee laptops.Bottom line: LlamaFarm turns AI from experiments into repeatable, secure releases, so teams can ship fast.What we have working today: Full RAG pipeline: 15+ document formats, programmatic extraction (no LLM calls needed), vector-database embedding, universal model layer that runs the same code for 25+ providers, automatic failover, cost-based routing; Truly portable: Identical behavior from laptop → datacenter → cloud; Real deployment: Docker Compose works now with Kubernetes basics and cloud templates on the way.Check out our readme&#x2F;quickstart for easy install instructions: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;llama-farm&#x2F;llamafarm?tab=readme-ov-file#-...Or just grab a binary for your platform directly from the latest release:\n  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;llama-farm&#x2F;llamafarm&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latestThe vision is to be able to run, update, and continuously fine-tune dozens of models across environments with built-in RAG and evaluations, all wrapped in a self-healing runtime. We have an MVP of that today (with a lot more to do!).We’d love to hear your feedback! Think we’re way off? Spot on? Want us to build something for your specific use case?

I recorded a [new video](https://youtu.be/nza_576YrHo) diving into the details, giving credit to Theo’s approach (props where due).\n\nBut here’s the kicker: even with his setup, **Cloudflare still outperforms Vercel** in my tests. For fairness, I’m hitting Paris DCs for both providers.\n\nSo why don’t Theo’s results match mine? A few theories:\n\n* Paris DCs are quantum-entangled with another universe.\n* Theo’s Vercel VMs are secretly nitro-boosted.\n* Massive performance gaps between data centers.\n\nSidenote: Cloudflare restricts performance.now(), forcing client-side measurements (including round trips). My original bench used heavy compute to render network latency negligible, but Theo’s runs too fast for my liking. Still, I didn’t dare changing a single line of his code 😅.\n\nWhat’s your take? Are DC differences this wild, or is something else at play?",

There’s no lack of demand: hugging face’s SO-100 and LeKiwi are pretty clear successes already; but the hardware is unreliable, the software experience is barebone and keeps changing, and you often need to buy hidden extras to make them work (starting with a computer with a good gpu). The Turtlebots were good, but are getting outdated.The open-source hobbyist movement lacks really good platforms to build on, and we wanted something robust and accessible. MARS is our attempt at making a first intuitive AI robot for everyone.What it is:- It comes assembled and calibrated- Has onboard compute with a jetson orin nano 8gb- a 5DoF arm with a wrist camera- Sensors: RGBD wide-angle cam, 2D LiDAR, speakers- Control via a dedicated app and a leader arm that plugs in iPhone and Android- 2 additional USB ports + GPIO pins for extra sensors or effectors.- And our novel SDK called BASIC that allows to run it like an AI agent with VLAs.It boots in a minute, can be controlled via phone, programmable in depth with a PC, and the onboard agent lets it see, talk, plan, and act in real-time.Our SDK BASIC allows to create “behaviors” (our name for programs) ranging from a simple hello world to a very complex long-horizon task involving reasoning, planning, navigation and manipulation. You can create skills that behaviors can run autonomously by training the arm or writing code tools, like for an AI agent.You can also call the ROS2 topics to control the robot at a low-level. And anything created on top of this SDK can be easily shared with anyone else by just sharing the files.This is intended for hobbyist builders and education, and we would love to have your feedback!p.s. If you want to try it, there’s a temporary code HACKERNEWS-INNATE-MARS that lowers the price to $1,799.p.p.s The hardware and software will be open-sourced too, if some of you want to contribute or help us prepare it properly feel free to join our discord at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;YvqQbGKH",

      "content": "I pushed Python to 20,000 requests sent/second. Here's the code and kernel tuning I used.\n\n  \n**What My Project Does:** Push Python to 20k req/sec.\n\n**Target Audience**: People who need to make a ton of requests.\n\n**Comparison**: Previous articles I found ranged from 50-500 requests/sec with python, figured i'd give an update to where things are at now.\n\nI wanted to share a personal project exploring the limits of Python for high-throughput network I/O. My clients would always say \"lol no python, only go\", so I wanted to see what was actually possible.\n\nAfter a lot of tuning, I managed to get a stable **\\~20,000 requests/second** from a single client machine.\n\nThe code itself is based on `asyncio` and a library called `rnet`, which is a Python wrapper for the high-performance Rust library `wreq`. This lets me get the developer-friendly syntax of Python with the raw speed of Rust for the actual networking.\n\nThe most interesting part wasn't the code, but the OS tuning. The default kernel settings on Linux are nowhere near ready for this kind of load. The application would fail instantly without these changes.\n\nHere are the most critical settings I had to change on both the client and server:\n\n* Increased Max File Descriptors: Every socket is a file. The default limit of 1024 is the first thing you'll hit.ulimit -n 65536\n* Expanded Ephemeral Port Range: The client needs a large pool of ports to make outgoing connections from.net.ipv4.ip\\_local\\_port\\_range = 1024 65535\n* Increased Connection Backlog: The server needs a bigger queue to hold incoming connections before they are accepted. The default is tiny.net.core.somaxconn = 65535\n* Enabled TIME\\_WAIT Reuse: This is huge. It allows the kernel to quickly reuse sockets that are in a TIME\\_WAIT state, which is essential when you're opening/closing thousands of connections per second.net.ipv4.tcp\\_tw\\_reuse = 1\n\nI've open-sourced the entire test setup, including the client code, a simple server, and the full tuning scripts for both machines. You can find it all here if you want to replicate it or just look at the code:\n\n**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/lafftar/requestSpeedTest**](https://github.com/lafftar/requestSpeedTest)\n\nOn an 8-core machine, this setup hit \\~15k req/s, and it scaled to \\~20k req/s on a 32-core machine. Interestingly, the CPU was never fully maxed out, so the bottleneck likely lies somewhere else in the stack.\n\nI'll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions. Let me know what you think!\n\n**Blog Post (I go in a little more detail)**: [https://tjaycodes.com/pushing-python-to-20000-requests-second/](https://tjaycodes.com/pushing-python-to-20000-requests-second/)",
