# NicheRadar Scoring Weights Configuration
# ======================================
# 
# Trọng số cho công thức NicheScore:
# NicheScore = w1*TrendMomentum + w2*GHVelocity + w3*HNHeat + 
#              w4*NewsDelta + w5*RedditEngagement - w6*CompetitionProxy + w7*FeasibilityFit
#
# Tất cả trọng số phải có tổng = 1.0 để đảm bảo score trong khoảng [0,1]
# Có thể điều chỉnh thủ công hoặc qua feedback loop
