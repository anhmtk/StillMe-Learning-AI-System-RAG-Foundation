## ⚠️ Limitations Acknowledged

### Understanding Nature
Semantic understanding through pattern recognition, not consciousness

### Capabilities
Can understand and explain code, but cannot autonomously modify code

### Human Role
Human developers remain creators and maintainers of StillMe

### Deterministic Operation
StillMe operates through deterministic code, not autonomous decision-making

### Scope
Understanding is limited to indexed codebase, may not cover all edge cases

---

## 🔬 Technical Notes

### Methodology
Self-comprehension measured through RAG-based code retrieval and Q&A accuracy

### Indexing Method
Codebase indexed using AST parsing, chunked by file/class/function

### Q&A Method
Questions answered using semantic search over indexed code chunks

### Score Calculation
Weighted combination of Q&A accuracy (60%) and indexing coverage (40%)

## 📝 Conclusion

This report documents StillMe's **first technical self-comprehension milestone** - the ability to understand and explain its own source code implementation through semantic analysis.

**Key Achievement:** StillMe can now answer questions about its own architecture, components, and implementation with 100.0% accuracy.

**Future Vision:** This baseline enables research into AI self-improvement, where understanding current implementation is the first step toward suggesting improvements.
