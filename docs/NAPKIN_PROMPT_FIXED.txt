Create a modern, professional tech flowchart titled "StillMe: Transparent, Validated RAG System"

STYLE: Dark navy background (#0A1628), modern tech aesthetic, high contrast, social media optimized

VERTICAL FLOW (top to bottom, sequential):
1. User Query - Purple node (#8B5CF6), speech bubble icon, white text
2. Language Detection - Purple node (#8B5CF6), globe icon, white text  
3. RAG Retrieval - Purple node (#8B5CF6), search icon, white text
4. LLM Generation - Purple node (#8B5CF6), robot/brain icon, white text
5. Multi-Layer Validation Chain - **EMERALD GREEN node (#10B981) - DIFFERENT COLOR FROM OTHERS**, shield icon, white text (THIS IS THE KEY FEATURE - MUST STAND OUT)
6. Post-Processing - Purple node (#8B5CF6), gear icon, white text
7. Transparent Output - **BRIGHT CYAN node (#06B6D4) - DIFFERENT COLOR FROM OTHERS**, eye/transparency icon, white text (highlight the final output)

White arrows connecting all nodes sequentially. Rounded rectangles. Clean, minimal design. 
16:9 or square format. Professional, suitable for Twitter/LinkedIn/ProductHunt.

CRITICAL COLOR REQUIREMENTS:
- Validation Chain MUST be GREEN (#10B981) - NOT purple like others
- Output MUST be CYAN (#06B6D4) - NOT purple like others  
- All other nodes are Purple (#8B5CF6)
- This color differentiation is ESSENTIAL for marketing - Validation Chain is the key differentiator

Sequential flow only - Validation Chain → Post-Processing (NOT parallel).
