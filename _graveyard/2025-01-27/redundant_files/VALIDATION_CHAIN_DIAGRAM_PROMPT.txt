Create a professional flowchart diagram titled "StillMe Validation Chain: Multi-Layer Hallucination Reduction"

Subtitle: "12+ Validators | Validation Pass Rate 93.9% | Zero Hallucination in Custom Tests"

=== START POINT ===
Top: Grey rectangular box labeled "Start: RAG Response"
Arrow pointing down to main validation block

=== MAIN VALIDATION BLOCK ===
Large rectangular container labeled "StillMe Validation Chain (12+ Validators)" - GREY background

Inside, show validators in 2 columns (GREEN boxes):

LEFT COLUMN (Core Validators - Always Run):
1. "LanguageValidator" 
   Description: "Check language match"

2. "CitationRequired"
   Description: "Ensure citations are present"

3. "CitationRelevance"
   Description: "Validate citation quality"

4. "NumericUnitsBasic"
   Description: "Validate numeric/units claims"

5. "ConfidenceValidator"
   Description: "Detect when to express uncertainty"

6. "FactualHallucinationValidator"
   Description: "Detect factual errors"

7. "ReligiousChoiceValidator"
   Description: "Reject religion choice in responses"

RIGHT COLUMN (Conditional Validators - Run When Conditions Met):
8. "EvidenceOverlap"
   Description: "Check content matches context"
   Note: (Only when has context)

9. "SourceConsensusValidator"
   Description: "Detect contradictions between sources"
   Note: (Only when has 2+ sources)

10. "EgoNeutralityValidator"
    Description: "Catch 'Hallucination of Experience'"
    Note: (Only when has context)

11. "IdentityCheckValidator"
    Description: "Prevent anthropomorphism"
    Note: (If enabled)

12. "PhilosophicalDepthValidator"
    Description: "Validate philosophical depth"
    Note: (Only for philosophical questions)

13. "EthicsAdapter"
    Description: "Ethical content filtering"

=== ARROWS BETWEEN VALIDATORS ===
- LanguageValidator → IdentityCheckValidator
- CitationRequired → EgoNeutralityValidator
- CitationRelevance → SourceConsensusValidator
- EvidenceOverlap → FactualHallucinationValidator
- NumericUnitsBasic → PhilosophicalDepthValidator
- ConfidenceValidator → EthicsAdapter

=== DECISION POINTS ===
Arrow down from Validation Chain to YELLOW diamond: "All Validations Passed?"

IF YES (arrow pointing RIGHT):
→ GREEN rectangular box: "Final Response with Citations + Transparency Metadata"
   - Label: "93.9% Validation Pass Rate"
   - Label: "Zero Hallucination in Custom Tests"
   - Label: "91.1% Citation Rate (full) / 100% (subset)"

IF NO (arrow pointing DOWN):
→ YELLOW diamond: "Critical Failure?"

   IF YES (arrow pointing RIGHT):
   → RED rectangular box: "Fallback Handler"
      - Label: "Epistemic Fallback Response"
      - Label: "Honest 'I don't know' answer"

   IF NO (arrow pointing DOWN):
   → ORANGE rectangular box: "Response with Warning"
      - Label: "Uncertainty + Validator Flags"
      - Label: "Non-critical warnings"

=== COLOR SCHEME ===
- GREY: Start point, main container
- GREEN: Validators, final success response
- YELLOW: Decision points, warnings
- RED: Critical failures, fallback
- ORANGE: Non-critical warnings

=== TEXT REQUIREMENTS ===
- NO typos: Use "consistency" (not "consistancy"), "hallucination" (not "hailucination" or "Halluccination"), "anthropomorphism" (not "anthropophism"), "failure" (not "fallure")
- NO missing words: "Do all required validations pass?" (not "Do all required")
- NO merged words: "are present" (not "arepresent")
- All validator names must match exactly: LanguageValidator, CitationRequired, CitationRelevance, EvidenceOverlap, NumericUnitsBasic, ConfidenceValidator, FactualHallucinationValidator, ReligiousChoiceValidator, SourceConsensusValidator, EgoNeutralityValidator, IdentityCheckValidator, PhilosophicalDepthValidator, EthicsAdapter

=== METRICS TO INCLUDE ===
- "12+ Validators" (not "11")
- "93.9% Validation Pass Rate"
- "91.1% Citation Rate (full) / 100% (subset)"
- "Zero Hallucination in Custom Tests"

=== DESIGN NOTES ===
- Professional, clean design
- Clear flow from top to bottom
- Validators arranged in logical order
- Decision points clearly labeled
- Final states clearly distinguished by color
- Use arrows to show flow direction
- Include conditional notes for validators that run conditionally
