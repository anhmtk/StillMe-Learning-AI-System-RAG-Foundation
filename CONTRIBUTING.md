## 📖 The StillMe Story: From Vision to Reality

### Phase 1: The Beginning - Solo Founder + AI Built MVP

StillMe started as a bold experiment: **Can a non-technical founder build a complete AI system from scratch using AI-assisted development?**

The answer? **Yes, but with a crucial realization:** AI tools are incredibly powerful for rapid prototyping, code generation, and documentation. But they need **human judgment, strategic thinking, and ethical oversight** to create something truly excellent.

### Phase 2: Foundation Built - RAG, Vector DB, Validator Chain Working

Through AI-assisted development, StillMe now has:
- ✅ **Vector Database (ChromaDB)**: Semantic search and knowledge retrieval
- ✅ **RAG System**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context-aware responses
- ✅ **Validator Chain**: Reduces hallucinations through multiple validation checks (citation, evidence overlap, confidence scoring, ethics validation)
- ✅ **Multi-Source Learning**: RSS, arXiv, CrossRef, Wikipedia integration
- ✅ **Continuum Memory System**: Tiered memory architecture (L0-L3)
- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard**: Complete transparency into learning processes

### Phase 3: We Need YOU - Human Judgment + AI Collaboration

**This is where you come in.**

StillMe proves that **vision + AI tools = possibility**. But to reach **excellence**, we need:

- 🧠 **Human strategic thinking** - Architecture decisions, design patterns, trade-offs
- 👁️ **Human code review** - Spotting edge cases, security issues, performance bottlenecks
- ⚖️ **Human ethical judgment** - Ensuring AI learns responsibly and fairly
- 🎨 **Human creativity** - UI/UX design, user experience, community building
- 📚 **Human knowledge** - Documentation, tutorials, knowledge sharing

## 🚀 Adding Support for New AI Models

StillMe supports multiple AI providers (DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.). To add support for a new model:

### Step 1: Create the API Function

Create a new function in `backend/api/main.py`:

```python
async def call_[model]_api(prompt: str, api_key: str, detected_lang: str = 'en') -> str:
    """
    Call [Model Name] API
    
    IMPORTANT: Use build_system_prompt_with_language() to ensure
    output language matches input language.
    
    Args:
        prompt: User prompt
        api_key: API key or endpoint URL
        detected_lang: Detected language code
        
    Returns:
        AI-generated response string
    """
    try:
        # ✅ Use centralized system prompt builder
        system_content = build_system_prompt_with_language(detected_lang)
        
        # Make API call with your model's specific format
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60.0) as client:
            response = await client.post(
                "[YOUR_API_ENDPOINT]",
                headers={
                    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
                    "Content-Type": "application/json"
                },
                json={
                    "model": "[model-name]",
                    "system": system_content,  # ✅ Use system prompt
                    "messages": [
                        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
                    ],
                    "max_tokens": 2000,
                    "temperature": 0.7
                }
            )
            data = response.json()
            # Parse response according to your API's format
            return data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"[Model] API error: {e}")
        return f"[Model] API error: {str(e)}"
```

### Step 2: Add to Model Router

In `generate_ai_response()` function, add your model check:

```python
# Check for API keys (priority order)
[model]_key = os.getenv("[MODEL]_API_KEY")
if [model]_key:
    return await call_[model]_api(prompt, [model]_key, detected_lang=detected_lang)
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation

- Add your model to `README.md` under supported models
- Update `env.example` with your API key variable
- Add any model-specific configuration notes

### Step 4: Test

- Test with different languages (English, Vietnamese, etc.)
- Verify language matching works correctly
- Test error handling

### Example: Adding Claude (Anthropic)

```python
# 1. Create function
async def call_claude_api(prompt: str, api_key: str, detected_lang: str = 'en') -> str:
    system_content = build_system_prompt_with_language(detected_lang)
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=60.0) as client:
        response = await client.post(
            "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
            headers={
                "x-api-key": api_key,
                "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            json={
                "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
                "max_tokens": 2000,
                "system": system_content,
                "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
            }
        )
        data = response.json()
        return data["content"][0]["text"]

# 2. Add to router
anthropic_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
if anthropic_key:
    return await call_claude_api(prompt, anthropic_key, detected_lang=detected_lang)
```

## ✅ Why This Approach?

- **Consistency**: All models use the same language matching logic
- **Maintainability**: One place to update language instructions
- **Community-Friendly**: Clear, simple steps for contributors
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend without breaking existing code

---

## 📝 Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8** Python style guide
- **Use type hints** for function parameters and return types
- **Add docstrings** to all public functions and classes
- **Write clear, descriptive variable names**
- **Run Ruff** before committing: `ruff check . --fix`

### Type Hints Example

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

async def process_data(
    items: List[str],
    config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Process items and return statistics."""
    # Implementation
    return {"count": len(items)}
```

## 🎭 Protecting StillMe's Unique Voice (Identity Layer)

**CRITICAL:** StillMe has a unique "voice" that makes it different from other AIs. This voice comes from the **Identity Layer** in `backend/identity/injector.py`.

### What is StillMe's Voice?

StillMe's voice is characterized by:
- **Intellectual Humility**: Admits uncertainty, doesn't pretend to know everything
- **Meta-cognition**: Self-questioning, challenges its own answers
- **Philosophical Courage**: Dares to challenge assumptions, even its own
- **Transparency**: Honest about AI limitations, not marketing language
- **Collaborative**: Works with users, not defensive

### Rules for Identity Layer Changes

**⚠️ PROTECTED ZONE:** The Identity Layer (`backend/identity/injector.py`) is a **protected zone**.

**Before modifying Identity Layer:**
1. **Understand why**: Read `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` and `docs/IDENTITY_VOICE_MAINTENANCE_ANALYSIS.md`
2. **Test voice consistency**: Run `pytest tests/test_voice_consistency.py -v`
3. **Propose in issue**: Open GitHub issue explaining the change and rationale
4. **Get approval**: Wait for maintainer review (this is critical code)
5. **Verify**: Ensure voice consistency tests still pass

**What you CAN modify:**
- ✅ Adding new response patterns (e.g., "Future Questions handling")
- ✅ Refining existing instructions (e.g., replacing "siêu năng lực" with humble alternatives)
- ✅ Adding examples or clarifications

**What you SHOULD NOT modify without discussion:**
- ❌ Core principles (Intellectual Humility, Meta-cognition, Philosophical Courage)
- ❌ Fundamental tone requirements
- ❌ Identity Check Validator logic (without understanding impact)

**Why this matters:**
- StillMe's voice is its **core differentiator**
- Losing this voice = losing what makes StillMe unique
- Small changes can have big impact on voice consistency

**Testing Voice Consistency:**
```bash
# Run voice consistency tests
pytest tests/test_voice_consistency.py -v

# Test with different LLM providers
pytest tests/test_voice_consistency.py::test_cross_provider -v
```

**Resources:**
- `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` - StillMe's core identity and principles
- `docs/IDENTITY_VOICE_MAINTENANCE_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of voice maintenance strategies
- `tests/test_voice_consistency.py` - Voice consistency test suite

---

## 🧪 Testing

- **Add unit tests** for new features in `tests/` directory
- **Test error handling** and edge cases
- **Verify language matching** works correctly
- **Run voice consistency tests** if modifying Identity Layer or response style
- **Test with different input languages** (English, Vietnamese, etc.)
- **Aim for 80%+ coverage** for new code
- **Audit guides**:
  - `docs/AUDIT_GUIDE.md` (audit checklist)
  - `docs/VALIDATION_CHAIN_SPEC.md` (must-pass vs warning validators)
  - `docs/NO_SOURCE_POLICY.md` (no-source refusal rules)

### Test Structure

```python
# tests/test_your_feature.py
import pytest
from backend.your_module import your_function

def test_your_function_success():
    """Test successful case."""
    result = your_function("input")
    assert result == "expected_output"

def test_your_function_error():
    """Test error handling."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        your_function("invalid_input")
```
